# My Codewars Solutions

Here are my codewars solutions. They are organized by question names, languages, and orders of completion.

Since not any character used in Codewars questions can be used in path, I write a script. Usage:

```console
$ python3 name_converter.py encode [question name]
[directory name]
$ python3 name_converter.py decode [directory name]
[question name]
```
